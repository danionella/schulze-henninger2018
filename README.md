# Ultra-small, transparent and genetically accessible vertebrate brain with rich behavior

## Analysis of vocalizations
The code provided demonstrates the detection of vocalizations generated by *Danionella translucida* and generates a plot of the acoustic waveform and the detected vocalizations.

### System requirements
All analyses of vocalizations were performed with Python 2.7.12, Numpy 1.11.0, Scipy 0.17.0 and Matplotlib 1.5.1 on a 64-bit running Ubuntu-Linux Version 16.04. 
The script has been tested exclusively on Linux. However, we anticipate that the script is runnable on Windows, Mac without changes.

No non-standard hardware is required.

### Python
For Linux users we recommend the installation of Python and the packages mentioned above via the system's package manager and the Python package manager 'pip', respectively. 
For Windows users we recommend to use the Anaconda Python distribution available at https://www.anaconda.com/download.
Typical install time: about 30 minutes, after download. 

## Demo data
Instructions on how to run our analysis scripts on demo data are provided in the folder *vocalization analysis*. For expected output see files in the sub-folder *expected_results*. Expected run time for demo on a current standard desktop computer is a few seconds.

example data: vocalization_analysis/Fig2E_raw.wav
example script: vocalization_detection.py
example command: in the script-folder run 'python vocalization_detection.py'
